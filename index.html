    This HTML file is created purely with HTML and CSS.  No extra scripts were used for these pages.
    Then again, if this turns out to be extremely ugly, then maybe that's immediately obvious.

    As it turns out, I'm not a good artist.  Or a designer, for that matter.

                    My name is Logan Ruan, a Canadian citizen born in China.  My legal name Mingxi Ruan, but I seldom use it, resulting in many awkward interactions when
                    my official government papers list a name I do not commonly use.
