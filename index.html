    This HTML file is created purely with HTML and CSS.  No extra scripts were used for these pages.
    Then again, if this turns out to be extremely ugly, then maybe that's immediately obvious.

    As it turns out, I'm not a good artist.  Or a designer, for that matter.

                <p>Welcome to my site!  Here, you can find a collection of my projects, including code, storywriting, and more to come!</p>

                <p>The purpose of this website is to formally provide a place to host all my works.  The most prominent project being my personal writing.

                <p>
                    My name is Logan Ruan, a Canadian citizen born in China.  My legal name is Mingxi Ruan, but I seldom use it, resulting in many awkward interactions when
                    my official government papers list a name I do not commonly use.
