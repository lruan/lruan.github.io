                    "One thousand years ago, twelve people of immense power, wishing to flee their desolate, shattered old world, gathered upon a nexus of great power and made a single wish."
                    <br><br>
                    A man, in his early thirties, marched back and forth in an open room. He taught without a board behind him or a book in hand, addressing an audience of one while reciting historical records from memory. Before him, a young boy no older than seven sat quietly and attentively behind a solid, wooden desk. A single notebook, accompanied by a quill pen and a bottle of black ink sat on the desk. The boy would occasionally pick up the quill and jot down notes as the man spoke, writing as neatly as he can.
                    <br><br>
                    But the boy was still just a child, young and unformed, his writing resembled messy sprawls all over the page despite his best efforts for tidiness. The teacher made a note of the boy's poor attempts at calligraphy, but said nothing critical. Though he would occasionally humor the thought of the boy going back to re-read his notes, perhaps at an older age, and being unable to discern his own writing.
                    <br><br>
                    Points to the boy for trying, he supposed. He's taught other children before, but none were like him - he was intent to learn. The boy before him had a quality unlike anyone he'd ever met, even at the young age of 7, he practically brimmed with discipline and obedience. When dealing with children like this, he would either grow up amounting to nothing more than a pawn of society, or aspire to great heroism. It was his task to shape the boy toward the latter, for the boy before him was royalty.
                    <br><br>
                    Due to his position, he was in close contact with Ardyan royalty. He's their most trusted ally, even though his origin and home are foreign to the land. He was personally requested by this boy's parents to come in every weekend to lecture the boy in whatever subject he wished - history, combat, science... Whatever topic he happened to muse about at the time. The topic today was history, a history of the birth of this world and of the City-state of Ardya, a topic that he was particularly fond of. The enthusiasm for his own topic showed today more than ever, as he caught himself speaking too fast and too wildly for the boy a few times in the lecture already.
                    <br><br>
                    The boy in front of him was his only student, but he found himself to be endlessly proud of his pupil. Aside from the boy's unnatural obedience for such a young child, during an age when they would run wild and discover the world on their own to sate their ever-shifting attention spans, he also behaved with great maturity. The boy would never complain during a lecture and would never plead with him to have the lesson be a demonstration of swordsmanship instead, he treated every lesson with the gravity it deserved, and seemed to share his teacher's zeal for knowledge and the world.
                    <br><br>
                    "Their wish was granted, but to do so, they labored through great trials that turned them into heroes and legends. For their service, they were granted a single, magical seed, and were taken to a new world. They planted the seed and nurtured it to maturity, when it became a great tree that radiated life. Some of the twelve chose to stay with it, and upon it a city-state was built. The same city-state you live in today."
                    <br><br>
                    He paused and watched the boy scribble away, wondering if his vocabulary was perhaps too complex for the young child before him to comprehend, but the boy didn't seem to complain or look up in confusion.
                    <br><br>
                    "The tree received care from all sorts of people - the humans that settled around it, the beautiful Sylphs who then took refuge to the west, and of course, the Nightingales."
                    <br><br>
                    "Oooh, ooh!" The boy suddenly perked up and wildly swung his hand in the air, "Like you are, sir!"
                    <br><br>
                    "Correct!" The teacher cheered the boy, "Nightingales are a group of ancient people who were given fantastic powers. There were only a hundred of us a thousand years ago, they were pilgrims who walked a long road to become who they are. And in return, they became incredible warriors."
                    <br><br>
                    "I know, I know!" The boy piped up excitedly, "Father told us how one Nightingale once took down an army by himself! And one of them even ripped apart a quarter of a city, and..."
                    <br><br>
                    The instructor's face turned solemn, letting the boy continue his excited tirade, "Yes, those are all true," he said, "It is an ancient, terrible power that only a select few humans wield, and passed down only by blood. Nightingales accept a vigil for their power - for as long as they live, they must remain in devotion to a person, or a place, they're sworn to protect it until they die. For most Nightingales, our vigil is bound to your city-state, we are to defend Ardya at all costs."
                    <br><br>
                    "Yeah!" The boy cheered, "You guys are like our heroes! Everyone in Ardya is so happy because you guys are always here to protect us, and no one can stand up to you guys!"
                    <br><br>
                    The instructor managed a weary smile, "It's not always that simple. It's not all glory, you know, the true heroes of the city-state are those who command it, like your parents... And one day, you. But one thing will remain true - the Nightingales will be there for you."
                    <br><br>
                    "I can't wait to meet more of them!" The boy grinned from ear to ear, "They're my heroes, I want to be just like them!"
                    <br><br>
                    "That's... Difficult," the instructor chuckled, "Nightingale powers are only passed down by blood, little one. It's possible for normal humans to learn some of our powers, but they can never truly master it."
                    <br><br>
                    The boy settled down after hearing this and asked again, "But sir, will you ever teach me some of your powers?"
                    <br><br>
                    "I can certainly try if you want," the instructor nodded, "but it's hard. Although you've done well in some basic footwork so far, what do you say we give it a shot?"
                    <br><br>
                    The boy cheered and practically leaped up from his seat, excitedly running to the weapon racks where his practice tools - a small, wooden sword crafted just for him - sat quietly amidst the rumbling steps. But this time, the boy was too excited, and instead reached for another blade - a long, azure sword hanging on a decorative emblem above the rack. The instructor saw the boy's zeal and immediately reached out to stop him.
                    <br><br>
                    "Wait, lad!" He called out, "Don't grab that sword."
                    <br><br>
                    "Why not?" The boy said, "I can handle it, I promise!"
                    <br><br>
                    "It's not that," the man shook his head, "Do you remember what I told you last session about the Artifacts?"
                    <br><br>
                    "Oh, I remember!" The boy nodded, "There are seven of them, right? They've existed for as long as the world has, and this sword is one of them!"
                    <br><br>
                    "Yes, it is called the Tideturner," the instructor explained, "But there's something I didn't tell you - the Artifacts are alive and have minds of their own. They belong to a single person, and will not work in anyone else's hands. The Tideturner is a sword that represents Ardyan royalty, the symbol of strategy and brilliance. Its powers are only usable by your father. You cannot use it yet, little one, it's best to stick with your practice tools for now."
                    <br><br>
                    "So I can't hold it?" The boy asked, deflated.
                    <br><br>
                    "You can try, but the sword will refuse you," The instructor said, "It will not listen to you. It's best to practice with what you have for now. But one day, you will inherit that sword, and you will use it to perform great deeds."
                    <br><br>
                    The boy was a reasonable one, and quickly got over his initial disappointment. He loved the lessons with his Nightingale mentor, he always made sure to teach the boy things about the world, as well as anything the boy wanted to know. The teacher was like his second father, but one he can actually ask more things to and expect an earnest response. His favorite thing, however, was always the sparring session. He can tell his teacher always went easy on him, but would also never let him win, making the boy always want to practice more to one day grow up to surpass his mentor.
                    <br><br>
                    Several hours later, the mentor ceased instructions for the day and bid the boy and his family farewell. He made his way out the ornate front door and beheld the violet gardens to his sides. The crown princess - that boy's mother - made a point to groom this garden into a beautiful sight, and especially preferred any flower that happened to be violet. It seemed a bit too monochromatic at a distance, but it was a beautifully maintained garden nonetheless. Its beauty was even inspirational - maybe he'll hurry home to make his property prettier, too.
                    <br><br>
                    He noticed a small pair of eyes spying on him from a corner. It was a familiar sight - he knew who those eyes belonged to, one of the twin younger sisters of the boy he mentors. She was the younger one, and almost every session he could detect her spying on his lessons. The little girl was probably only five years old, and she was the quiet and timid one of the family - always keeping to herself. Her spying was harmless, and he found it amusing that she seemed interested in his lessons, so he'd always let it slide. But he felt rather whimsical today, and decided that today was the special day.
                    <br><br>
                    He turned around and noticed the girl quickly retreating back to the corner she was peeking out from. Smiling, he approached the girl and lightly tapped her, "Hi there."
                    <br><br>
                    The girl, realizing the game is up, quickly shuffled back a few steps and stared down on the ground, nervously fidgeting with a corner of her dress and blushed fiercely.
                    <br><br>
                    "What's your name?" He asked, but the girl didn't answer.
                    <br><br>
                    "I know you've been peeking at your brother during his lessons this whole time," he said, "I've always noticed you, I just thought I'd come say hi today."
                    <br><br>
                    "Are you..." The girl squeaked out a few quiet sounds, "Are you going to tell on me?"
                    <br><br>
                    "Why would I?" He shrugged, kneeling down so he could be at the same height as the girl he was addressing, "I think it's great that you're curious in my lessons. You're always welcome to join us, you don't have to peek."
                    <br><br>
                    "No, no..." The girl shook her head wildly, "I don't want them to know..."
                    <br><br>
                    "What do you mean?" He asked, but she went back to being quiet.
                    <br><br>
                    After a while, it was clear that the girl wasn't willing to talk. It puzzled him - she's growing up in a very loving family, it's unlikely for her to have anything to hide to her parents, or her brother, for that matter. Why she would secretly eavesdrop on his lessons but refuse to formally attend it was a mystery to him, a mystery that she wasn't going to explain anytime soon. He eventually gave her a quiet but consoling pat on her shoulders, rising up to leave.
                    <br><br>
                    "Wait!" She called out suddenly, "You... You are teaching my brother about the the Nightingales, right?"
                    <br><br>
                    "Right." He turned back around to face her, "I'm one, too. Your brother seemed curious."
                    <br><br>
                    "You're teaching him how to fight like one, too..."
                    <br><br>
                    "Not completely," he said, "Your brother, or you, for that matter, are not Nightingales. Your brother will only learn how to fight like us, but he can never really become one and use this power as I can."
                    <br><br>
                    The girl took a step forward and opened her mouth to speak, but was taken back several times by her own timidness. Realizing that she was taking up too much of the man's time, she finally shut her eyes and blurted out a single sentence:
                    <br><br>
                    "Can... Can you teach me, too?"
                    <br><br>
                </p>
