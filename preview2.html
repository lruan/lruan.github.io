                <h3>Prelude 2 - The Girl and the Rapier</h3>
                <h5><i>Originally conceptualized in 2008, the very first chapter to the long-time saga was rewritten in late 2017.</i></h5>

                    "You're here! Finally!" The girl jumped cheerfully once she spotted her master come out of the palace. The teacher reciprocated, simply greeted her with a quick wave of his hand. Not as enthusiastic as previous days, he seemed distracted and distraught today, but she chose to not comment on it too much. She'd stopped regularly sneaking peeks at his lessons to her brother, sometimes opting to spend that time practicing instead, today was no exception, though her master showing up so late today was worrying to her.
                    <br><br>
                    "I'm sorry I took so long," he said. Even his tone was different today. It wasn't the same, friendly tone she was used to. This one was solemn, steep, and perhaps even a hint of sorrow.
                    <br><br>
                    "That's alright," She smiled widely, ear-to-ear, hoping her demeanor will provide her master with some good cheer, "As long as you're here! Shall we start?"
                    <br><br>
                    "Let's start." He nodded, "Last week's routine, demonstrate it again, after your warmup. Go."
                    <br><br>
                    "You got it!" She cheered and went to dance about, beginning with some simple stretches to warm herself up. The teacher watched her go about and took a seat, trying to calm the endless swirling thoughts in his head.
                    <br><br>
                    She wasn't the same timid girl that shied away from him two years ago. As these secret lessons happened, he watched as she grew during her childhood, how she began to open up more to him as time went on, eventually becoming the playful sprite before his eyes now. She confided in him through these lessons, telling him secrets that he's sure she had never told anyone else.
                    <br><br>
                    Ever since he started mentoring the boy, he quickly went from a close family friend to a second father. Perhaps the girl latched onto him as well. She seemed closer to him than to her real family. He found himself appreciating it, gradually looking forward to his secret lesson every weekend.
                    <br><br>
                    She was a natural genius. Though she only requested combat lessons from him, she'd make a point to chat with him during break time about the lessons he'd give to the boy. He discovered her silent aptitude for absorbing information at an incredible rate. At times, he wondered if she surpassed her older brother, who already stood out to him as the brightest pupil he'd ever taught. Even aside from her intellect, he also found her to be surprisingly deft. With but a single practice sword in hand, she mirrored his techniques almost flawlessly. He found himself testing her over the past two years, stacking on more and more lessons, then sitting in shock as she absorbed his lessons with ease. On this day, he'd already taught her just about everything he knew.
                    <br><br>
                    How can a mere child be so talented? He wondered, but he found himself to take more and more pride in having mentored her. Though it was dangerous for normal humans to take in Nightingale powers, she seemed to handle even basic Nightingale training with little effort - a topic he originally did not think of ever touching in such a short span of time. He discovered a strange power within her - psychic potential. She had the brightest future ahead of her, and now, it would be up to her to walk the correct path.
                    <br><br>
                    All that just made it hurt more.
                    <br><br>
                    "How's that?" The girl boasted, he snapped back and realized he'd just missed her entire demonstration. She didn't even break a sweat performing last week's routine, something even her brother couldn't master yet, and she was only seven years old.
                    <br><br>
                    "Good. Very good." He nodded, "You're very talented."
                    <br><br>
                    "Thank you!" She bowed and blushed lightly, delighting in compliments, "It's all thanks to you, master! You're the best teacher ever!"
                    <br><br>
                    He smiled wearily and curled his fingers in toward her, gesturing her to approach. She skipped up to him and allowed him to quietly stroke her hair. Something seemed off about him today, she thought.
                    <br><br>
                    He ran his hand through her hair, never dropping his weary smile. She'd felt this before - something her parents would do to express affection, it always calmed her down and made her feel loved. This time, it strangely felt as if her own father was before her for a brief moment. Yet his hand felt different than her father's, though it was equally firm and gentle, there was a silent emotion being communicated here - sadness, longing... Heartbreak. A premonition of an eternal farewell.
                    <br><br>
                    "I have something for you today," he said, briefly cheering up, "here, I snuck it into the lesson for you."
                    <br><br>
                    He reached into his coat and produced an elegant, long box and handed it to her. She carefully received it and unwrapped the ribbon hastily prepared to bind the lid. Within, a beautiful, silver rapier sat quietly in the middle of the box. It was the prettiest sword she'd ever seen.
                    <br><br>
                    "Wow!" Her eyes widened, "This is beautiful!"
                    <br><br>
                    "This rapier is called the Silverwind," he said, "I commissioned it from the finest Nightingale silversmiths just for you. It's yours now."
                    <br><br>
                    "Really!?" She looked up, jumping in excitement, tightly clasping the box to her chest, instantly pushing the gift to the top of her list of favorite possessions.
                    <br><br>
                    "I noticed a strange power in you," he said, "You are psychic. Not telepathically, but telekinetically. Your mind can be turned into a deadly weapon, and with practice, it can be channeled and controlled. The best alloy to use as a medium for the mind is silver, so I had the silversmiths tailor something for you. It's made to be as light as possible, you vastly favor speed over power in your stances, this rapier is, in every way, made just for you."
                    <br><br>
                    "Thank you, master!" She gave him a deep bow, one unlike a child to give, "I want to use it now! But... It's so big."
                    <br><br>
                    "Of course," he chuckled - but today, even his laugh felt empty, "This rapier is meant for you when you're an adult. You're too young still to be holding real weapons. Once you come of age, this rapier should fit you perfectly. Can you promise me? Promise me that you'll do wonders with this by your side."
                    <br><br>
                    "Of course!" She cheered excitedly, "I promise, master, I'll practice every day until I can use it! Let's start our lesson, I can't wait!"
                    <br><br>
                    He froze. The air in the palace suddenly turned the opposite direction, the child was perceptive enough to notice something amiss, her cheer suddenly froze and crashed to the ground.
                    <br><br>
                    "Listen, sweetie," she heard her master speak, "I'm sorry... I don't have a new lesson for you today."
                    <br><br>
                    "Oh," she answered, somewhat disappointed, "I noticed you weren't feeling well, maybe you should go home."
                    <br><br>
                    An instant flicker of pain struck across his face.
                    <br><br>
                    "You... Deserve to know," he said. It was unlike grown men to cry, and he certainly wasn't going to shed tears, but his voice cracked apart, she felt alerted to it and instantly gazed at him, a cold chill ran through her body, "The reason I came out so late today... Today will be our last lesson."
                    <br><br>
                    "Last lesson? Why?" She asked. The looming dread intensified.
                    <br><br>
                    "I'm going away, to somewhere," he said, absent-minded. She noticed that he looked away from her, his eyes weren't even focused on anything, "I don't know what will happen, but... I don't think I'll be coming back."
                    <br><br>
                    "Where are you going?" She pressed. He knew this wasn't going to be easy, she was going to press him for an answer he cannot give.
                    <br><br>
                    "Is this because my parents found out? That you've been secretly teaching me?" She demanded, he had to look away from her completely and just allow her to vent. Her cheer had vanished completely by now and replaced with tears swirling in her eyes, frustration and helplessness in her voice, it was difficult for him to face.
                    <br><br>
                    "Are they angry? Did they pull you aside and yell at you for teaching me how to fight secretly? Or is it because of me? Did I perform badly last week? If so, I can make it up this week! I promise, I'll be good, I..."
                    <br><br>
                    "No, please, stop." He pleaded, "Listen to me, please... It's not your parents, they don't know, I've kept your secret. It's not you, either - you were flawless, you have no idea how proud I am of you, you are an amazing child, you'll grow up to be an amazing person... I truly believe it."
                    <br><br>
                    "But..." She protested, wiping the tears from her eyes, "Why are you leaving? Where are you going?"
                    <br><br>
                    He stood up, much against her protest, setting his sights away from the palace, and away from her.
                    <br><br>
                    "You're still just a child. Maybe one day, you'll find out, but not today, please... I've already said my goodbyes to the rest of your family, your brother wasn't happy about it, either. Just know that you, and your brother... And even your twin sister, the three of you are all the finest children I've ever seen... I am so happy that the future of Ardya are in the hands of such capable children."
                    <br><br>
                    "Don't forget.. I'll always be proud of you, please continue to practice... Don't sully your talent, you can become so much more... Your future rests entirely in your hands, make sure to grasp it and pilot it to where you feel is right."
                    <br><br>
                    "I'm sorry that the end is so abrupt... This world is radiant, but never failing to be cruel. I wish I can make this easier, but I can't... There are some things even a Nightingale cannot do."
                    <br><br>
                    He turned back and looked at her one last time. Tears were now flowing down his face - a feeling he hasn't had in years.
                    <br><br>
                    "Goodbye... I'm sorry."
                    <br><br>
                    He started to walk away. The girl was inconsolable, but he knew he cannot make her feel better, no matter how much he wanted to.
                    <br><br>
                    "But... But why? Why are you leaving?" She screamed after him, running a few steps out of the palace in a final attempt to halt her master.
                    <br><br>
                    He kept walking, there was no turning back for him now. But he had one final thing to say to her, in the most incinerating voice he can, forever burning a single sentence into the girl's mind, which was sure to linger in her head for the rest of her life:
                    <br><br>
                    "Please remember us. Please remember our names, our legacy... Remember the Nightingales."
                    <br><br>
