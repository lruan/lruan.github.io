                    Millia Clouding strode past scattered tents and camps, quietly parting the cloths to a makeshift tent. Shroud was inside, pouring over a map of his immediate surroundings, brows furrowed in a tight knot. He seemed to be extremely focused, quite uncharacteristically, he didn't even hear Millia enter the room.
                    <br><br>
                    Millia stood by and watched him pouring over the map for a time, slightly amused that Shroud seemed totally oblivious to her arrival. After a while, when it was obvious that he would not look up anytime soon, Millia brought her hand up to her mouth and feigned a loud cough.
                    <br><br>
                    Shroud jumped up, alerted, immediately grabbing the Tideturner beside him and unsheathing it in one, swift motion, he brought the blade toward the makeshift tent's entrance and pointed it directly at Millia. Shroud quickly identified her, breathing a quick sigh of relief and dropped his guard sheepishly.
                    <br><br>
                    "Millia!" Shroud settled, exhaling a heavy breath, "You scared me."
                    <br><br>
                    "It's unlike you to be so tunneled on something," Millia smiled softly, "This isn't a good image for one of your soldiers to be walking in to. It's not good for them to see their commander so distraught."
                    <br><br>
                    Shroud chuckled, "Can you blame me?"
                    <br><br>
                    "I could, if I wanted to, but I'm supposed to be nice to you." Millia answered. The pair broke into a round of laughter, a long-awaited respite from the stress. The sight of a familiar face filled Shroud with more mirth than he cared to admit. Having operated out in the fields for so long, it felt like an eternity since he last saw Millia.
                    <br><br>
                    "Why are you out here, Millia?" Shroud asked, "For you to be able to pull yourself away from Ardya... Either all's very well or everything home's on fire. Which one is it?"
                    <br><br>
                    "You should have more faith in your little sister than that," Millia chuckled, "Your sister is quite an angel, you know... She is quite literally holding the city-state together, as long as she's there, Ardyan citizens are content to live their lives."
                    <br><br>
                    "She's amazing, I know," Shroud said, relieved to hear some good news back home, "Though she worries over us too much, I hope she's doing well for herself."
                    <br><br>
                    "She's doing well enough to send me here," Millia grinned, "She thought you would need me more here than at home. She says that she misses you and Siren, too."
                    <br><br>
                    "We miss her, too," Shroud sighed, "It felt like ages since I was last home."
                    <br><br>
                    "How's everything out here?" Millia asked, "I walked by some tense faces on my way in, I wouldn't say we're on the cusp of victory."
                    <br><br>
                    "Cusp of victory? You're hilarious." Shroud shook his head snidely, "If it wasn't for Siren's intelligence reports, Dhuria would've rolled us over by now. It feels like every day is a test of survival, we're staying afloat, but I don't blame the soldiers for losing their morale."
                    <br><br>
                    "That's where you're supposed to come in!" Millia chided, "You're their commander, they look to you for guidance and support. You don't just exist to command them, you know."
                    <br><br>
                    "I try my best," Shroud answered, "But I'm just one person."
                    <br><br>
                    He walked over to the entrance of the tent and quietly brushed one side open, peeking outside at the soldiers making camp for the night. Some of them seemed more weary than others. There was a range of emotions, going from absolute placidity to disturbingly fearful.
                    <br><br>
                    "These aren't trained or disciplined soldiers," Shroud said sorrowfully, "These are rag-tag militia, volunteers, and just a handful of people that's actually seem combat. Most of them haven't held a sword until the hasty training sessions months ago. These aren't killers - they're sons, daughters, fathers, mothers... There are people inside Ardyan walls praying every day for their safety. They are only here because they are willing to put their lives on the line to protect something dear to them, whatever it is."
                    <br><br>
                    "They are just citizens, people who prefer to live every day in peace, people who would shake and wilt before anyone that even remotely threatens them on the streets. Now they are out here, facing a legion of bloodthirsty pillagers who would trample them twice over without breaking a sweat. But they're still here, they are being driven by their own willingness to be here. They all have something so precious to them that they are willing to lay their lives on the line for it - even if they know that it is likely to be futile, but they still try."
                    <br><br>
                    Shroud looked outside and closed his eyes, exhaling a heavy sigh.
                    <br><br>
                    "These men and women... They are all better people than I," He said, "they are willing to fight, they refused to stand by and watch. Yet here I am, Tideturner in hand, expected to command them and send them to their doom. Every day, someone in Ardya have their prayers go silent. I don't know how I can ever answer for this."
                    <br><br>
                    He finally turned back to Millia, letting go of the curtains and letting the tent shut itself, "I'm not you, Millia. You are an admiral's daughter, you have a natural air of assertiveness that I do not. I have to be decisive here, but you seem to do it so naturally."
                    <br><br>
                    "Don't compare yourself to me," Millia smirked, "I'm just a foolish girl who once chose to end her own life, trying to run away from something I find myself caught up in now. I've simply decided to stop running, only because I owe a lot to your family for taking me in, and treating me like family..."
                    <br><br>
                    "These people answer to you, Shroud," Millia said, "You're not going to let them down, are you?"
                    <br><br>
                    "Of course not." Shroud said, lowering his eyelids slightly, "Come look at this map."
                    <br><br>
                    He gestured to the map of the field he was staring at just a while ago, drawn to great detail with a myriad of flags placed at several locations, some in blue and a lot more in red, "Relying on Siren's intelligence is only good enough to be reactive. We need to win to stay alive, I've been isolating some outer camps we could try to hit. If we can move fast enough, we can get in and out before they even know what happened."
                    <br><br>
                    "Playing guerrilla, then," Millia nodded, "Do you have a place in mind?"
                    <br><br>
                    "This one." Shroud nodded, pointing to one of the red flags closest to where their camp is, "Apparently, this place is a forward camp for the Dhurian cavalry. Their cavalry's always been a huge headache to deal with, I would love to cripple it if I can."
                    <br><br>
                    He looked up from the map and toward Millia.
                    <br><br>
                    "Of course, now that you're here, I'm suddenly a lot more confident about this. Are you in?"
                    <br><br>
                    "You kidding?" Millia chuckled, "You think I came out here to sightsee?"
                    <br><br>
