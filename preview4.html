                    Seven ancient structures held dominion over the continent.  All seven structures were identical to each other, their only difference being color.  Six of the seven each sits in one corner of the world – Azure, Amethyst, Granite, Sanguine, Sylphen, and Purity.  The six palaces formed the vertices of a hexagon around the entire land.  In the middle of the six, equidistant to all palaces, was the famous Golden Palace.
                    <br><br>
                    No one from the other places knew what was inside the Golden Palace.  Adventurers and archaeologists alike had journeyed to it from all corners of the world.  They came back bearing gifts of gold, knowledge of the world, and pristine artifacts excavated from the ancient burials.  The returning explorers were hailed as heroes and gleefully informed the people of a nearly endless spring of wealth in the grand tower.  Stories of roads paved with gold, adobe walls coated in glittering dust – they’d brought home all they could carry, even throwing away their supplies for more loot from the Palace of Promises.
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately, explorers from nearly all over the world came, yet there was only a single Golden Palace.  When the palaces sent larger expedition squads, they met each other at the Golden Palace.  Arguments of ownership quickly devolved into full-fledged threats, into skirmishes…  Then into an all-out slaughter.  For the limitless treasure buried within the Golden Palace, miners and prospectors from the other six Palaces attacked each other brutally.  With the lack of weapons, they murdered each other with shovels, strangled then with empty bags meant for the promise of wealth within.  The straggling survivors fled back to their respective lands, reporting the brutality of that day.  While most of the Palaces sighed and mourned over the temptation of greed, some others did not take to it kindly.
                    <br><br>
                    The endless legions of the Sanguine Palace took to the incident as an affront to war.  Secretly, they prepared their legions and used the feud over the Golden Palace as an excuse for warfare.  Within two weeks after the first wave of battered explorers returned to the Sanguine Palace, their armies marched on, dividing five ways onto the other five Palaces in the world.  What seemed to be an eternity of peace came to a swift end.
                    <br><br>
                    Though the seven palaces are identical, the six populated ones are each very distinct in culture and beliefs.  When given the same base, they each took the palace and altered it in ways to suit their own needs.  Before long, bustling cities and nations took place around the palaces, making them autonomous states.
                    <br><br>
                    The Azure Palace, in terms of military, is no doubt among the bottom of the six.  Which, up until the point of the Sanguine Invasion, did not matter much.  Aside from their weak military, the Azure Palace was overall unremarkable – it was not the most advanced Palace of the six, nor was its culture anything to be marveled at.  It was utterly unremarkable to the other palaces, except to itself.  The people living inside the Azure Palace spend each day contently.  There was no rush to move forward, nor was there a compelling need to do so.  Peace and happiness was the reigning factor in the Azure Palace, people would settle in, find love, and remain there for all of eternity in perfect harmony.
                    <br><br>
                    There are the commoners and the nobility classes residing in the Azure Palace.  One group resided in, or near the grand palace structure itself, the rest spread themselves amongst the many towns, cities, and villages created around it.  However, there is a third social class that are exclusive to few.  Everyone has a different name for this class, the nobility refers to them as “mercenaries”, while the commoners refer to them as “soldiers”.  And those belonging to the third class itself refer to themselves as “Striders”.  Striders make up most of Azure Palace’s defensive forces, but they are neither a part of the commoner’s militia nor the nobility’s military.
                    <br><br>
                    Striders are independent soldiers brought up in the world of combat.  They do not receive the normal training of the Azure Palace militia or military.  Instead of practicing stances or drills, their expertise comes as forced necessities to ensure survival.  Often times, their need to survive served as informal training that vastly outpaces the standardized drills taught to normal soldiers.  Each of the Striders became elite combatants despite having no training, and as a result, are far more relied on for any sort of mercenary work where a sword is welcomed than the military – much to their dismay.
                    <br><br>
                    As people continued about their activities, commoners and nobles alike, it was not uncommon to use hired help for escort or as bodyguards.  As a result, the Striders were given special classes in the hierarchy.  They were permitted to mingle amongst the commoners and nobles, as needed.  As long as they do not violate the ultimate law set in the Azure Palace - the ban on interclass marriage.
                    <br><br>
                    Lena zel Percaria nor Schwartz – a commoner who resided in the Azure Palace, was an outlier on that matter.  Normally, the length of one’s name directly corresponded with the height of your class in the Azure Palace.  Yet Lena’s name, normally assigned to the highest classes of nobility, were born amongst the commons.  The inclusion of the terms “zel” and “nor” meant “mothered by” and “fathered by”, respectively, and usually only used in naming by nobles.  Her mother was among the nobility, her father was a commoner.  Their violation of the ultimate law was something they spent their lives to hide from the public eye.  Lena cast away her whole name and went by the name “Lena Schwartz” to all formal documents of her life, as did her mother.  But their secret was leaked one day by an unknown source, and her parents were arrested and sentenced as a result.  Lena was taken away from their care and sent into an orphanage.
                    <br><br>
                    As Lena grew up, she received word of her parents’ passing in prison.  She couldn’t recover their corpses, but instead made makeshift graveyards in the commons area, and vowed to them that she’d find the one who leaked the secrets of her family.  She recovered her family heirloom – dual blades crossed against each other atop a fireplace.  One blade was made by the nobility, the other made amongst the commons.  She disappeared from both the commons and the nobility for a very long time, and came back as a full-fledged Strider.
                    <br><br>
                    There are no official designations of Striders save for a single organization in the center of the Azure Palace – the Strider Guild.  The guild itself only has two purposes:  To accept new Striders and assign tasks provided by the rest of the populace.  Anyone can join the Striders, but to keep the position was something else entirely.  Applying Striders are given ten tasks to fulfill, chosen to make sure human lives won’t be on the stake.  To become a Strider, the applicant cannot fail in any of the ten given tasks as a rite of passage.  Lena, still disguising her full name, caught the attention of the Strider Guild quickly.  A lone woman armed with dual blades and nothing else completed her ten test tasks faster than any other Strider ever had, and much more cleanly.  Before long, she gained a minor degree of fame in the Azure Palace and became the number one Strider people went to.  The more dangerous the task, the more they relied on her.
                    <br><br>
                    One day, Lena received a mission from a stranger, it took her out of the Azure Palace and into foreign lands.  Directly neighbouring the Azure Palace on the hexagonal arrangement was the Amethyst Palace on one side, and the Sanguine Palace on the other.  Lena packed her belongings and headed to Amethyst, missing the Sanguine Invasion force by less than an hour – when she left, the Sanguine Invasion began.
